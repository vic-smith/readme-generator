# readme-generator 

## Application Description
Use this app to create a professional README file for your project. Simply answer the prompts and the app will do the rest. This app utilizes npm inquirer to take in user input that is then added to a README template through the use of template literals. A writefile function is then called to create the new README file in the dist folder.
